    <h3 class="subtitle">Description</h3>
    <p>
      Stinky (or fermented) tofu might not sound like the most appetising
      food, but don't be put off by the name! It's true that it does have an
      intense aroma and a corresponding depth of flavour, but as well as
      that it's rich in several key nutrients and fits well into a healthy diet
      or weight loss programme. So what is stinky tofu? Well, it's made from a
      mixture of firm tofu (which you can buy fresh or make yourself from soft
      tofu and a tofu press), fermented bean curd, plus a few other ingredients.

    <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>14 oz of firm tofu, cubed</li>
      <li>4 tbsp stinky fermented bean curd</li>
      <li>2 finely chopped green onions</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of red chilli peppers</li>
      <li>2 tsp potato starch or 1 tsp cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>2 finely chopped cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp parsley</li>
      <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp powdered fennel</li>
      <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a large sealable container, such as a tupperware or
      plastic food storage container with a fitted lid.</li>
      <li>In this, mix together the white vinegar, water and stinky
      fermented bean curd until you have a consistent liquid.</li>
      <li>Place your tofu, chopped into chunks of around 1 in square,
      into the liquid, seal, and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours. The
      longer you store it, the stronger the flavour will be.</li>
      <li>Remove the tofu chunks from the liquid and drain them thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Heat the oil in a wok, and fry your tofu chunks until the
      surface is golden. Place them to one side on a plate.</li>
      <li>Now fry the garlic until it becomes fragrant, and then add
      the oyster sauce, fennel powder and half a cup of water.</li>
      <li>Bring it to the boil, then add the tofu chunks back into
      the wok and simmer for one minute.</li>
      <li>Add chopped parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
